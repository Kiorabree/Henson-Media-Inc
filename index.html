			<h2>Valuations</h2>
			<p>Henson Media uses several different approaches starting with a description and background of the station. A financial analysis is undertaken, looking at the station’s sales and profit levels and appropriate multiples are applied, as well as a rate of return analysis. After that, there’s usually a review of comparable sales and an analysis of the stations’s assets. Adjustments are made based on the economic vitality of the station’s market, the level of media competition and other factors.</p>
